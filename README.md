## 📄 Paper Overview

**Title**: SecureVault – A Zero-Knowledge Password Manager with Blockchain-Anchored Integrity

**Authors**: Given Name Surname

**Institution**: dept. name of organization, name of organization

## 🔗 Live Paper

**[📖 Read the Paper Online](https://yourusername.github.io/securevault-paper/)**

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: All encryption/decryption happens client-side
- **Blockchain Integrity**: Merkle root anchoring for tamper detection
- **No Single Point of Trust**: Eliminates reliance on central servers
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Only hashes stored on-chain, not encrypted data

## 🏗️ System Architecture

- **Frontend**: React.js with Web Crypto API
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with MongoDB
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Sepolia smart contracts
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation

## 📊 Features

- Client-side encryption with master key never leaving device
- Blockchain-anchored integrity verification
- WebAuthn biometric authentication
- Breach monitoring via HaveIBeenPwned API
- Tamper-evident data verification

## 🛡️ Security Analysis

The paper includes comprehensive security analysis covering:
- Confidentiality through zero-knowledge architecture
- Integrity via blockchain anchoring
- Threat model analysis
- Comparison with existing solutions

## 📚 Methodology

The research follows a structured methodology including:
1. System Architecture Design
2. Client-Side Encryption Process
3. Key Management and Authentication
